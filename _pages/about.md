I am an assistant professor in the School of Finance, Economics and Government of EAFIT University, where I coordinate the Seminar on Politics and Development and the DataPOL research group. Before moving to Colombia, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Bobst Center for Peace and Justice of Princeton University. I received my PhD in 2022 from the European University Institute. Please find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p44dfo1097qxmnp2qs7rm/202409_cv.pdf?rlkey=ckc95vijofz17wq7rdibpn7yc&st=q3d14ajc&dl=0).


My research mostly focuses on the legacy of violent experiences (and periods) and how and why it changes.
